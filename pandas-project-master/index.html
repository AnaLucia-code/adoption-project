            >Anecdotal evidence</a
          >
          shows that more Americans are fostering and adopting pets since the
          coronavirus pandemic began to spread. According to
          <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=pet%20adoption"
            >Google Trends data</a
          >, searches for “pet adoption,” and similar search terms have risen
          worldwide from a month ago.

        <p class="g-copy">
          But what about across different states in the US? Comparing Google
          searches for “coronavirus” with searches for “pet,” over the last
          three months shows that some states with higher numbers of confirmed
          coronavirus cases have lower rates of searching words like “pet.” The
          District of Columbia, for example, has a search rate of only 2 (out of
          100), a proprietary Google Trends measurement system, and has over
          2,00 confirmed cases of coronavirus.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          New York state also has one of the lowest rates of searches for “pet,”
          with a Google Trends value of 3. Yet the state is currently the
          epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the US.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          On the other end of the spectrum, South Dakota has a higher value of
          searches for “pet.” Its value is 5, and the state currently has less
          than 1,000 confirmed coronavirus cases.

                  for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {

                      (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px");
                  }

          There is obviously a huge gap between searches for the term
          coronavirus and searches for the term pet. Although anecdotally we
          know that animal fostering has gone way up in New York City, for
          example, that’s obscured by how many searches there are for
          coronavirus in the state.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          A challenge of using Google Trends analysis is that you can only view
          searches as a part of all searches in that area. This means when
          searches rise for another term, the value for the term we are trying
          to observe decreases as a result.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          An analysis that may show us more going forward is comparing the
          change in searches for “coronavirus” and searches for “pet” over a
          period of time.
